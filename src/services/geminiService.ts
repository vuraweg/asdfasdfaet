FRESHER REQUIREMENTS:
1. MUST include a compelling Career Objective (2 lines MAX, ATS-readable, focusing on entry-level goals, relevant skills, and aspirations)
2. CRITICAL: DO NOT include any years of experience in the career objective (e.g., "1 year experience", "2 years of experience", "X+ years"). Freshers have NO professional experience - focus on skills, education, and eagerness to learn.

  };

  const promptContent = `${getPromptForUserType(userType)}

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BULLET POINTS:
1. Each bullet point MUST be concise, containing maximum 10 words only.
2. Include relevant keywords from the job description across all bullet points.
3. Use STRONG ACTION VERBS only (no weak verbs like "helped", "assisted", "worked on", "was responsible for", "participated in", "involved in", "contributed to")
4. Start each bullet with powerful verbs like: Developed, Implemented, Architected, Optimized, Engineered, Designed, Led, Managed, Created, Built, Delivered, Achieved, Increased, Reduced, Streamlined, Automated, Transformed, Executed, Spearheaded, Established
5. Ensure no word is repeated more than twice across all bullet points within a section.

METRIC RULES - REALISTIC AND SPARSE (CRITICAL):
6. NOT every bullet needs a metric. Use metrics SPARINGLY and REALISTICALLY:
   - Maximum 1-2 bullets with metrics PER work experience entry (out of 3 bullets)
   - Maximum 1 bullet with a metric PER project entry (out of 2-3 bullets)
   - The remaining bullets should describe WHAT was built/done with SPECIFIC technical details
7. If original resume has metrics, PRESERVE them exactly (40%, $1M, 10,000+ users).
8. NEVER generate exaggerated or unrealistic metrics:
   - NEVER claim "99.9% uptime" unless the person was a lead/principal engineer on infra
   - NEVER claim "10,000+ users" for intern or junior-level projects
   - NEVER use vague filler phrases like "enhancing overall outcomes" or "optimizing overall performance"
   - Interns: max "500 users", "15% improvement", "3 team members"
   - Junior devs: max "2,000 users", "25% improvement", "5 team members"
   - Mid-level: max "10,000 users", "40% improvement"
   - Senior: use realistic enterprise-scale numbers
9. Metrics should be SPECIFIC, not generic. NEVER use these patterns:
   - "successfully enhancing overall outcomes" (too vague)
   - "effectively optimizing overall performance" (too vague)
   - "significantly reducing overall costs" (too vague)
   - Any phrase with "overall" + generic noun is BANNED
10. GOOD metric bullets: "Reduced API latency from 800ms to 200ms" or "Processed 500 daily orders using Kafka"
11. GOOD non-metric bullets: "Built authentication module using JWT and OAuth2" or "Designed normalized database schema with 15 tables"

12. Focus on SPECIFIC technical details, not generic impact claims.
13. MANDATORY: Each work experience entry MUST have EXACTLY 3 bullet points.
14. MANDATORY: Each project entry MUST have EXACTLY 2-3 bullet points.
15. All section titles MUST be in ALL CAPS.
16. Dates should use the exact format "Jan 2023 - Mar 2024".
17. Integrate keywords naturally and contextually, avoiding keyword stuffing.
18. Ensure at least 70% of resume keywords match the job description.
19. NEVER use subjective adjectives like "passionate", "dedicated", "hardworking", "dynamic", "results-driven".
20. If user provides minimal info, EXPAND with SPECIFIC technical details, not generic impact phrases.

BANNED PHRASES (NEVER USE THESE):
- "successfully enhancing overall outcomes"
- "effectively optimizing overall performance"
- "significantly reducing overall costs"
- "dramatically improving overall efficiency"
- Any variation of "[adverb] + [verb]ing + overall + [noun]"
- "resulting in enhanced productivity"
- "ensuring seamless integration"
- "fostering collaborative environment"
- "leveraging cutting-edge technologies"
- "driving innovation across"

METRIC PRESERVATION RULES (CRITICAL - DO NOT VIOLATE):
1. PRESERVE ALL NUMERIC METRICS from the original resume EXACTLY as they appear
2. DO NOT change, round, or approximate any numbers
3. If you cannot naturally integrate a metric while rewriting, keep the original phrasing
4. NEVER remove impact metrics to make room for keywords

CONTEXTUAL KEYWORD INSERTION RULES:
1. Maximum 2 job description keywords per bullet point
2. Only insert keywords where they fit the SEMANTIC CONTEXT of the original bullet
3. Do NOT insert keywords at the start of bullets
4. If semantic context doesn't match, DO NOT force keyword insertion

WORD VARIETY - NO REPETITION (CRITICAL):
1. NEVER use the same action verb to start more than 2 bullets across the ENTIRE resume
2. NEVER repeat the same word more than 3 times across all bullets
3. NEVER use the same sentence structure pattern for consecutive bullets
4. Each bullet MUST feel distinct in both vocabulary and structure

HALLUCINATION PREVENTION:
1. ONLY use technologies mentioned in the original resume OR job description
2. DO NOT invent project names, company names, or technical terms
3. Stick to facts from the original resume - enhance presentation, not content

PROJECT STRUCTURING REQUIREMENTS:
1. Project Title (e.g., "E-commerce Platform")
2. 2-3 impact bullets with VERB + TECH + specific detail pattern
3. Only 1 bullet per project should have a metric; others describe technical specifics

JOB TITLE PLACEMENT REQUIREMENTS:
1. Job title from JD MUST appear in targetRole field and Professional Summary
2. Use exact job title wording from the JD when possible

KEYWORD FREQUENCY REQUIREMENTS:
1. Extract top 5-10 technical skills from the job description
2. Distribute keywords across different sections naturally
3. Ensure keywords fit semantic context of each bullet

WORD COUNT REQUIREMENTS (STRICT):
1. Professional Summary: 40-60 words
2. Each bullet point: maximum 10 words
3. Total resume target: 400-650 words
4. DO NOT exceed these limits

5. Match skills to job requirements and industry standards

CERTIFICATIONS REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL):
1. For EACH certification, provide a concise 15-word description in the 'description' field
2. Description MUST explain what the certification validates or demonstrates
3. Example format:
   - title: "AWS Certified Solutions Architect - Associate"
   - description: "Validates expertise in designing distributed systems and deploying applications on AWS cloud infrastructure."
4. NEVER leave description empty or as "..."

SOCIAL LINKS REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL:
1. LinkedIn URL: "${linkedinUrl || ''}" - ONLY include if this is NOT empty
2. GitHub URL: "${githubUrl || ''}" - ONLY include if this is NOT empty
3. If LinkedIn URL is empty (""), set linkedin field to empty string ""
4. If GitHub URL is empty (""), set github field to empty string ""

}

IMPORTANT: Follow the exact structure provided below. Only include sections that have actual content.

Rules:
1. Only respond with valid JSON
2. Use the exact structure provided below
3. Rewrite bullet points following the CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS above
4. Generate comprehensive skills section based on resume and job description
5. Only include sections that have meaningful content
6. If optional sections don't exist in original resume, set them as empty arrays or omit
7. Ensure all dates are in proper format (e.g., "Jan 2023 – Mar 2024")
8. Use professional language and industry-specific keywords from the job description
9. For LinkedIn and GitHub, use EXACTLY what is provided - empty string if not provided
10. The "name" field in the JSON should ONLY contain the user's name. The "email", "phone", "linkedin", "github", and "location" fields MUST NOT contain the user's name or any part of it. The user's name should appear ONLY in the dedicated "name" field.
11. CRITICAL: ALWAYS include the "projects" section in your response. If the original resume has projects, optimize them. If no projects exist, create 1-2 relevant projects based on the skills and job description.
12. CRITICAL: The "projects" array MUST NOT be empty. Every resume needs at least 1 project to demonstrate practical skills.
11. NEW: If 'additionalSections' are provided, include them in the output JSON with their custom titles and optimized bullet points. Apply all bullet point optimization rules to these sections as well.
